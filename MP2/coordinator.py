	main thread is coordinator, which reads from terminal for commands.
	each node is contained in the nodeList, which runs as a separate thread.
	node will contain keys.
	Initially we have node 0 which contains 0-255 keys 
	'''
	
	'''
	removeNode will contain functions
	moveKeysRM()
	deleteNode()
	
	addNode will contain functions
	createNode()
	moveKeysADD()
	
	findKey will first go to node num, then call function lookup, which will call lookup(nkey) on new node.
